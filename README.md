# BD-1

<p align="center">

</p>

BD-1 is a local desktop companion that observes user activity and suggests a daily or
weekly time report. It is not a clock-in system: it stores factual observations and
recomputes suggestions on demand.

## Installation

Installable builds are published with each stable release:

<https://github.com/Obeo/bd1-timekeeper/releases/latest>

Development builds remain available from the latest successful build of `master`:
<https://github.com/Obeo/bd1-timekeeper/releases/tag/build/master>.

Download the asset matching your operating system:

- Windows: `bd1-windows-x86_64.exe`
- Linux: `bd1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`
- macOS: `bd1-macos-arm64.zip`

### Windows

Run `bd1-windows-x86_64.exe` and follow the installer. The application is installed
as `BD-1.exe` and can be launched at the end of the setup.

If autostart was enabled in a previous installation, reinstalling in a different
folder updates the existing Windows startup entry to the new executable location.

### Linux

Extract `bd1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`, then run the `BD-1` executable from the extracted
folder:

```bash
tar -xzf bd1-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
./BD-1/BD-1
```

### macOS

Extract `bd1-macos-arm64.zip`, then open `BD-1.app`.

### Updates

BD-1 checks the latest stable GitHub release at startup and once every 24 hours.
When a newer version is available, the tray menu offers the download for the
current operating system and displays a system notification when supported. The
downloaded installer or archive is never executed automatically.

This check sends an HTTPS request to GitHub, which necessarily exposes the IP
address and HTTP headers but no BD-1 data or telemetry. Set
`"update_checks_enabled": false` in `settings.json` to disable it.

### Settings

BD-1 creates a `settings.json` file in the user data directory resolved by
`platformdirs`. On Windows, this is typically:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\BD-1\BD-1\settings.json
```

#### idle_ignored_process_names

The `idle_ignored_process_names` setting lists process names that should prevent
BD-1 from turning keyboard and mouse inactivity into a break. This is useful for
meeting applications where the user may be working without touching the keyboard
or mouse.

By default, BD-1 includes the Zoom meeting processes `aomhost64.exe` on Windows
and `cpthost` on Linux:

```json
{
  "lunch_automatic_work_resume_time": "13:58",
  "idle_ignored_process_names": [
    "aomhost64.exe",
    "cpthost"
  ],
  "update_checks_enabled": true,
  "weekly_cap_hours": 37
}
```

To ignore more applications, add their process names to the list.

#### lunch_automatic_work_resume_time

The `lunch_automatic_work_resume_time` setting controls the time used when BD-1
detects activity during the protected lunch window. For example, if the computer
wakes up at 13:20 but this value is set to `13:58`, BD-1 keeps the lunch break
open until 13:58. Use the `HH:MM` format. Missing or invalid values fall back to
`13:58`. The value must be after `12:00` and no later than `14:00`.

#### weekly_cap_hours

The `weekly_cap_hours` setting controls the weekly target used when the
`Plafond 37h` option is enabled in the weekly report. It defaults to `37`.
For local testing, it can be set to a lower value such as `20`. Invalid or
non-positive values fall back to `37`.

#### Mattermost status

BD-1 can set your Mattermost custom status to `In the office` or
`Working remotely`. Open `Configurer` → `Intégration Mattermost` from the tray
menu, then enter the HTTPS URL of your Mattermost server and your personal
access token. You can also configure it from a terminal:

```bash
bd1 --configure-mattermost
```

The URL and VPN interface patterns are stored in `settings.json`; the token is
stored in Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, or the Linux Secret
Service. Settings changed from the tray UI take effect immediately.

BD-1 checks the network at startup and once per hour. A successful resolution of
`intranet.obeo.fr` through a physical interface means office; a failed resolution
or a route through OpenVPN means remote. Common `tun`, `tap`, `utun`, `ovpn`,
OpenVPN, and Wintun interface names are recognized. On Windows, BD-1 also checks
the adapter description so localized or renamed connections keep their driver
identity. Add other VPN interface names to `vpn_interface_patterns` in
`settings.json`, using case-insensitive glob patterns.

An active custom status set manually in Mattermost takes precedence over BD-1.
BD-1 statuses expire at the end of the local day and are refreshed the following
day. To opt out:

```bash
bd1 --disable-mattermost
```

On Linux, a Secret Service provider such as GNOME Keyring must be available.
BD-1 does not fall back to storing the token in plaintext.

## Development

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .
bd1
```

The base install supports reports, settings, and persistence. To run the tray
application and activity detection, install the desktop extra:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[desktop]"
```

On Linux, `pynput` depends on `evdev`, which may compile locally. If that build
fails with `Python.h: No such file or directory`, install the Python development
headers for your distribution, then retry the desktop extra.

The report windows use `tkinter`, which is packaged separately by some Linux
distributions. On openSUSE, install it if `bd1` fails with
`No module named 'tkinter'`:

```bash
sudo zypper install python313-tk
```

Useful commands:

```bash
bd1 --report today
bd1 --report week
bd1 --push-eurecia 29
bd1 --push-eurecia 29 --remember-eurecia-password
bd1 --mark-working
bd1 --mark-break
bd1 --diagnose-desktop
bd1 --profile-runtime
bd1 --no-activity-monitor
bd1 --enable-autostart
bd1 --disable-autostart
bd1 --autostart-status
bd1 --configure-mattermost
bd1 --disable-mattermost
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

`bd1 --push-eurecia 29` first prints the report for ISO week 29 of the current
ISO year. It requires explicit confirmation before requesting any missing
Eurecia credentials and printing each update step. To select another ISO year:

```bash
bd1 --push-eurecia 29 --year 2026
```

### Experimental Eurecia adapter

`bd1-eurecia` is a lightweight prototype for the private Eurecia web interface. It uses
Python's HTTP and cookie support directly: it does not embed Playwright or add a runtime
dependency. The password is prompted without echo.

Configure the tenant and account, then inspect week 23 of 2026:

```bash
export BD1_EURECIA_BASE_URL='https://<tenant>.eurecia.com/eurecia/'
export BD1_EURECIA_EMAIL='<account-email>'

bd1-eurecia list
bd1-eurecia --remember-password list
bd1-eurecia show --year 2026 --week 23
bd1-eurecia set-standard-week --year 2026 --week 23
```

The base URL must include the application path, for example
`https://<tenant>.eurecia.com/eurecia/`. Global options such as `--base-url`,
`--email`, and `--browser-session` must appear before the subcommand.

The client follows Eurecia's Keycloak SSO automatically for its password and e-mail-first
login forms. If the account requires MFA or another interactive identity-provider screen,
import an already authenticated browser session instead:

1. Open Eurecia normally in the browser and complete SSO.
2. In the browser developer tools, open **Network** and reload Eurecia.
3. Select the `api/v3/users/me/initData` request.
4. In **Request headers**, copy only the complete value of the `Cookie` header.
5. Run `bd1-eurecia --browser-session list`, paste the value into the hidden prompt, and
   press Enter.

The same option works with `show` and `set-standard-week`:

```bash
bd1-eurecia --browser-session show --year 2026 --week 23
bd1-eurecia --browser-session set-standard-week --year 2026 --week 23
bd1-eurecia --browser-session set-standard-week --year 2026 --week 23 --apply
```

Never paste that cookie into chat, source code, a shell command, or a committed file. The
adapter stores imported cookies only in memory and validates them immediately with
`initData`.

Without `--apply`, `set-standard-week` is a preview. If its current and target values are
correct, the explicit write command sets Monday through Friday to `09:00-12:00` and
`14:00-18:00`, saves through the observed `validate=2` and `btnApply=clicked` legacy form
contract, reloads the timesheet, and verifies every segment:

```bash
bd1-eurecia set-standard-week --year 2026 --week 23 --apply
```

Eurecia may reuse the `btnApply` HTML identifier for multiple workflow buttons. The adapter
uses an unambiguous `Enregistrer` control when available and otherwise relies on the unique
`validate` field; it never triggers submission or transfer buttons. It intentionally refuses
ambiguous forms, non-`POST` saves, timesheets whose status cannot be established as
`Nouvelle`, and rows that cannot be mapped safely. It supports the observed Eurecia Keycloak
password flow and importing an established browser session, but it does not automate MFA or
additional identity-provider screens. This is an unsupported private interface whose HTML
may change; see
[EURECIA_TIMESHEET_API.md](EURECIA_TIMESHEET_API.md) for the observed contract and current
limitations.

In the weekly report, **Pousser vers Eurecia** replaces editable rows on the displayed
working days with the displayed BD-1 work segments. The 37-hour cap is therefore applied
when it is enabled. Synchronized, locked rows such as paid leave and public holidays are
preserved; work for the same day is added on separate editable rows. BD-1 adds or removes
editable rows as needed, saves without submitting, then reloads the timesheet and verifies
the result.

The journal window reports every step, remains open on errors, and supports selecting and
copying its text. Its final success line is green; failures and the manual-entry instruction
are red. A verification error happens after the save request and does not imply a rollback:
the timesheet may already have been changed.

The first push requests the tenant URL, account email, and password. Later pushes request
only information that is not already available. The URL and email are saved in
`settings.json`. The password stays in memory unless the user selects
**Mémoriser dans le trousseau système** or passes `--remember-eurecia-password`
(`--remember-password` for `bd1-eurecia`). It is then stored in Windows Credential
Manager, macOS Keychain, or the Linux Secret Service, separately for each tenant and
email address. An expired session is authenticated again automatically. A rejected saved
password is requested again and replaced only after successful authentication.

When a working day contains a raw startup network observation classified as remote,
BD-1 adds `Télétravail/Remote` to the first exported Eurecia segment. Existing comments
are preserved, repeated exports do not duplicate the marker, and an office export removes
only that marker. Days recorded before network observations were introduced remain
unchanged because their location is unknown.

The SQLite database and `settings.json` live in the user data directory resolved by
`platformdirs`. On macOS, the configuration file is
`~/Library/Application Support/BD-1/settings.json`.
